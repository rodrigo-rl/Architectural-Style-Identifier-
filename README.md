# Architectonic Style Identifier 

This project has been developed as final assignment of the machine learning bootcamp of Core-Code school.
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning code which can identify the architectonic style of a building just with a picture of your phone.

## PROJECT STAGES
This project has been divided in some steps in order to organize the workload

1-	Organize and prepare the DATASET. The Dataset of this project can be downloaded from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dumitrux/architectural-styles-dataset?resource=download. This dataset contains around 10.000 pictures ordered by the architectonic stile.
2-	Try and fit some machine learning models to select the most adequate for this kind of project.
3-	Create an API in python connected to a DataBase to feed the model
4-	Create an Streamlit page to present the data from the API.
5-	Dockerize the code in Google Cloud to be sure that always is working
